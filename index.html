                    Gross national income (GNI), or gross national product, has been defined as the total income earned
                    by a nation’s people and business. It is one of the most common measures of a nation’s wealth, an
                    alternative to gross domestic product.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GNI adds the income from overseas sources and the gross domestic product of the nation together. It
                    includes the income of residents from any source, including foreign investment and even development
                    aid that is given by governments or other agencies.

            <div class="col-6 margin-r-paragraph">
                <p>
                    The formula to calculate the GNI of a nation is as below:
                </p>
                <p class="formula">
                    GNI = GDP + (EX - IM)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where EX represents the money flowing from foreign countries and IM represents money flowing to
                    other countries.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the choropleth map and scatterplot below, GNI per capita (GNI divided by
                    population of the country) of each year will be shown in the diagrams. This value represents the
                    average income of the residents in a particular country.

                        Diagrams above also show the distribution of countries in different regions such as Africa, the
                        Americas (a landmass comprising the totality of North America and South America), Asia, Europe,
                        and Oceania. From the choropleth map, one can tell that countries in South America, Europe, and
                        Oceania are typically having the higher gross national income (per capita) from 1965. Their GNI
                        is still above average until now the 21st century. This brings up the question, can money really
                        buy happiness?

                    In the last diagram, the population countries are compared with their GNI per capita, global peace
                    index, and world happiness index, to seek if there is any relationship between the income of a
                    nation and its security as well as the happiness of residents in the country. Data from 2018 is
                    chosen and used in the last diagram.

                    Global Peace Index (GPI) is an index measured and calculated by the Institute for Economics & Peace
                    (IEP). It is a composite index that measures the relative position of nations' and regions'
                    peacefulness. GPI is made up of 23 qualitative and quantitative indicators, including the level of
                    Societal Safety and Security, the extent of Ongoing Domestic and International Conflict, and the
                    degree of Militarisation. It is weighted on a scale from 1 to 5, the lower the index is, the more
                    peaceful the country is.
                </p>
                <p>
                    World Happiness Index, or World Happiness Report, is a publication of the Sustainable Development
                    Solutions Network from the United Nations. The ranking or score of happiness is measured with
                    variables including GDP, social support, healthy life expectancy, freedom to make life choices and
                    others. In 2021, it is also focusing on the effects of COVID-19 and how people have fared due to it.
                    The higher the score indicate happier people in the nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the diagram, although the GNI of a nation is not directly related to its peace and people’s
                    happiness, but the major trend shows that countries with high GNI tend to have higher happiness
                    score and lower peace index.
